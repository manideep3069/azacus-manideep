# azacus-manideep

# Objective
Develop a simple web application where users can view, add, edit, and delete user details from a mock backend API.

## Instructions to Run the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/manideep3069/azacus-manideep.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd azacus-manideep
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Assumptions Made

- The application uses JSONPlaceholder as the mock backend API.
- The `/users` endpoint of JSONPlaceholder is used to fetch and manipulate user data.
- The application is a simple web application with no server-side code.
- The application is designed to be run locally in a web browser.

## Challenges Faced During Development

1. **Handling Asynchronous Operations**: Managing asynchronous API requests and ensuring the UI updates correctly was challenging.
2. **Form Validation**: Implementing robust form validation to handle different user inputs required careful planning and testing.
3. **Pagination and Infinite Scrolling**: Implementing both pagination and infinite scrolling to handle user data display efficiently was a complex task.
4. **Error Handling**: Ensuring comprehensive error handling for API requests to provide meaningful feedback to users.

## Improvements if Given More Time

1. **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improve the user interface and user experience by adding more intuitive design elements and animations.
2. **Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests to ensure each function works as expected and to prevent future regressions.
3. **Server-side Implementation**: Develop a backend server to handle user data more securely and efficiently.
4. **Advanced Features**: Add more advanced features such as user authentication, role-based access control, and data export functionality.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the application for better performance, especially when handling a large number of users.
